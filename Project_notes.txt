1) Do species have reverse J distributions
figures: size distribution histograms
Numbers of SE, JU, SA, and then bins of tree size
Can also do bins of SAs by basal diameter

>>>> 2) Descriptive understory statistics of each plot BY QUAD - 2013
Total # SE, JU, SA (separately) per plot
> Conifer SE, JU, SA per plot (Doug Fir + Torreya)
> Hardwood SE, JU, SA # (total - Doug Fir - Torreya)
#Diversity - species richness - of SE, JU, SA and cumulative

#not for TBC3
#how similar is understory to overstory

3) what summary statistic - sum of JU + SA, or just SA, or SA + trees < 2 cm is most strongly correlated with LIDAR ladder fuel metrics (lidar hits 1-4 m above ground)

Weighted sums to describe understory density:
e.g., 3*SA + 2*JU + SE

>>> 4) How do we work across the SA/TR divide? DBH to basal diameter transfer function, heights of saplings as they reach 1 cm
- >>> plot DBH vs. basal diameter for threshold trees
- What is the min, average, max height of trees right at 1 cm dbh
- what are the max heights of saplings of each species?
- make height histograms for saplings of each species

  What is the dbh of a 4 m tree of each species? 

5) Are there signatures of doug fir understory, below oak? E.g. high ladder fuels
